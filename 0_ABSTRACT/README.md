# Abstract
## Project Name:
Oscilloscope

## Objective:
The main aim of this project is to design and stimulate a **Oscilloscope** using Atmega328P in SimulIDE through **Atmel Studio 7** as Integrated Development Platform.

## Brief Description about Project:
An oscilloscope  is a type of electronic test instrument that **graphically displays varying electrical voltages as a two-dimensional plot** of one or more signals as a function of time. The main purposes are to display repetitive or single waveforms on the screen that would otherwise occur too briefly to be perceived by the human eye. The displayed waveform can then be analyzed for properties such as **amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion,** and others. Originally, calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument.Modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly.
Oscilloscopes are used in the **sciences, medicine, engineering, automotive and the telecommunications industry**. General-purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be used to analyze an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an electrocardiogram, for instance.
Early high-speed visualisations of electrical voltages were made with an **electro-mechanical oscillograph** . These were superseded by the oscilloscope which used a cathode ray tube (CRT) as its display element, often referred to as Cathode Ray Oscilloscopes - CROs. CROs were later largely superseded by the digital storage oscilloscope(DSO) with thin panel displays, fast analog-to-digital converters and digital signal processors. These can have integrated displays, or can be an electronic module, sometimes known as a digitiser, which feeds into general purpose computer to **process, display and record waveforms**.

## Software Used:
**SimulIDE Software**- SimulIDE is a real-time electronic circuit simulator. It is a simple tool intended for advance learning, and it lets you enjoy the experience as well. SimulIDE is designed to be fast and easy to use, and it works wonders for simple electronics.
